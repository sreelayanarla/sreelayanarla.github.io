# Rockbuster Stealth – SQL Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth is a fictional movie rental company preparing to transition from physical stores to an online streaming platform.  
This project analyzes historical rental data to uncover customer behavior, revenue distribution, and regional performance to support data-driven business decisions.

---

## Business Objectives
The analysis was conducted to answer key strategic questions, including:
- Which countries and cities generate the highest revenue?
- Who are the top customers contributing to sales?
- Which film categories perform best?
- Which regions should be prioritized for business expansion?

---

## Dataset Description
The project uses a relational database containing multiple tables, including:
- Customers  
- Payments  
- Rentals  
- Films  
- Categories  
- Stores  
- Addresses  

The dataset was queried using **PostgreSQL**.

---

## Analytical Approach
- Wrote SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, and aggregate functions  
- Performed data validation and consistency checks to ensure accuracy  
- Analyzed revenue distribution across countries and customer segments  
- Identified top-performing film categories and high-value customers  
- Created summary tables to support strategic analysis  
- Built Tableau dashboards to visualize geographic and revenue trends  

---

## Key Insights
- Revenue was concentrated in a limited number of countries and urban regions  
- A small group of high-value customers contributed disproportionately to total revenue  
- Certain film categories consistently generated higher rental volumes  
- Regional performance varied significantly across markets  

---

## Visualizations
Interactive dashboards were created in Tableau to present insights clearly and effectively.
