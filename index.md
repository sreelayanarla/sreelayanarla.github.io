## About Me

Hi, I’m Sreelaya- a data enthusiast with a background in Computer Science and Marketing.

I’ve always been curious about patterns — whether in systems, markets, or human behavior. Over time, I realized I didn’t just enjoy building things, I enjoyed understanding them. That curiosity led me to data analytics — where logic meets storytelling.

I like giving data a story and context, not just numbers. For me, analytics is about making information clearer, more meaningful, and easier for people to understand.

Currently based in Germany, I’m building my career as a Junior Data Analyst and continuously sharpening my skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau.
